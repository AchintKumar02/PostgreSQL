1.AS
 it alow us to create an alias for coloumn or result
ex 
i)SELECT  column AS new_name from table.
ii) SELECT SUM (coloumn) AS new_name FROM table
 example SELECT amount AS rental_price FROM payment;

*The As operator gets executed at the vert end of a query 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2.Join 
   i.Join allow us to combine multiple tables together 
	the main reason for the different join types is to decide how to deal	
	with information only present in one of the joind tables. 

   2i) Inner Join will result with the set of records that match in both tables

	SYNTAX:
		SELECT * FROM tableA INNER JOIN TableB ON TableA.col_match = 	TableB.col_match.
	 
   2ii)OUTER JOINs
		There are few types of outer join They will allow us to specify 	how to deal with values only present in one of the tables being join. 
	
	a.FULL OUTER JOIN 
	b.LEFT OUTER JOIN
	c.RIGHT OUTER JOIN
	
	A> Full outer join: Grab everything wheather it is present in one table or in both table
	ex.
		SELECT * FROM TableA FULL OUTER JOIN TableB ON TableA.com_match = TableB.col_match
	
	B> left outer join
		A LEFT OUTER JOIN results in the set of records that are in the left table, if there is no match with the right table, the results are null.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3> UNION :-
	• The UNION operator is used to combine
	the result-set of two or more SELECT
	statements.
	• It basically serves to directly concatenate
	two results together, essentially "pasting"
	them together.

	Syntax:
			SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
			UNION
			SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;	


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------					Timestamps and Extract
					PART ONE
			   DISPLAYING CURRENT TIME INFORMATION
		
O TIME - Contains only time
○ DATE - Contains only date
O TIMESTAMP - Contains date and time
O TIMESTAMPTZ - Contains date,time,
timezone



• Let's explore functions and operations
related to these specific data types:
O TIMEZONE
O NOW
TIMEOFDAY
o CURRENT_TIME
o CURRENT_DATE

• EXTRACT()
o Allows you to "extract" or obtain a
sub-component of a date value
■ EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_col)



• AGE()
o Calculates and returns the current age
given a timestamp
o Useage:
■ AGE(date_col)
o Returns
13 years 1 mon 5 days 01:34:13.003423

. Mathematical Functions and Operators
 Table 9.4. Mathematical Operators
Operator Description Example Result
o  + addition 2+3 5
o - subtraction 2-3 -1
o * multiplication 2 3 6
o / division (integer division truncates the result) 4 / 2 2
o % modulo (remainder) 5%4 1
o ^ exponentiation (associates left to 	right) 2.0 3.0 8

ex:- 1 SELECT rental_rate/replacement_cost FROM film
------------------------------------------------------
0:String Functions and Operations
• PostgreSQL also provides a variety of string functions and operators that allow us to edit, combine,and alter text data columns.

string concattination 
syntax : string || String
ex:- first_name || last_name = Achintkumar
ex:- first_name || ' ' || last_name = Achint kumar
-----------------------------------------------------
			SubQuery

o-It allows you to perform a query on another query
  ex select student,grade FROM test_score Where grade >(select AVG(grade) from test_score)

o- The EXIST operator is used to test for existence of rows in a subquery
 Its opposit NON EXIST
Ex:- Select first_name, last_name From customer where Exist(select *from payment where customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id AND amount > 11)
--------------------------------------------------------
			SELF JOIN
o: A self-join is a query in which a table is joind to itself 
:- Self joins are useful fro comparing values in column of rows whithin the same  table .
The self join can be viewed as join of two copies of the same table.

o:-its neccesary to use alias for self join to prevent same name conflict.

ex:- SELECT tableA.col, tableB.com
FROM table AS tableA join table AS tableB
ON tableA.some_col = tableB.other_col
